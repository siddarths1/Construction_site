<h3> How building contracts work?</h3>

agreed between the builder and the client. 
Make sure to read the agreement thoroughly and ensure all elements of the construction are understood before signing.

Either party breaking the contract, the other party can appeal for damages. Some of the feature the contract should be included in:

       <li>How to treat variations which may arise during construction</li>
       <li>A termination conditions</li>
       <li>Price details</li>
       <li>Duration of the project</li>
       <li>What are to be ensured during construction?</li>
       </span>
       </ul>  

<h3> what to ensure during construction</h3>

<pre>
The entire construction process can be difficult to manage since there are several phases, 
responsibilities and tasks involved. It’s challenging to ensure that everything runs smoothly. 
Make sure that you have the right plan and strategy which help to make the construction process easier. 
Here are five key strategies to ensure during the construction process.
</pre>

       <ul>
       <span style="font-weight: 400;">
       <li>Quality and Safety</li>
       <li>Fixing</li>
       <li>Functions</li>
       <li>Monitoring each process</li>
       <li>Costs needed to complete the project</li>
       </span>
       </ul>  

<pre>
To ensure the quality construction process, you must initially figure out the tasks that 
should be completed during the project and assign an activity to each task.

For example, if you need drywalls to be installed for your dream house, 
then consider all the activities involved with this process.

Next, you need to ensure that you find out all the resources needed to complete the process. 
The resources could be manpower or equipment or materials etc.

Then you’ll need to schedule the timetable for each process as well as the approximate cost.

Realize that it may change in a certain time. Changes can impact your schedule and cost.
 However, an effective strategy and plan provides a strong framework 

which helps throughout your construction project.
</pre>

<h3> Final inspection and move in:</h3>
 
<pre>
You’ve picked out all your fixtures and finishes. You’ve selected your flooring and paint colors. 
Now the dream house you’ve been waiting for so long is ready! Finally, you can sign your closing paperwork and move in.

Ofcourse, there is a final walkthrough, that’s just a formality right?

But it is important that you need to be very thorough and observant during the walk-through time. 
Carefully examine all the surfaces of counters, fixtures, fitting, floors and walls for possible damage.

It might be tempting to rush through the final inspection in your newly-built home; 
there are some very important things that you need to investigate during inspection time. 
Don’t assume that everything is fine just because everything is clean and shiny. It requires some keen attention before a walk-in.

Take your time and inspect your newly constructed home along with your field engineer to examine the home carefully. 
Once after ensuring the quality of construction, you can move-in to your dream house, get comfortable and know that your hard work is done.
</pre>
